#Lesson 5

Start by checking out the `lesson5`branch

Last week you implemented the HotelsController and added an endpoint to search for hotels.  

This week we flesh out that search results page.
* Fix the tests in `HotelsControllerSpec` by looking at the clues included
* You can check your progress at http://localhost:9000/hotels/search?destination=London&distance=1.2
* You'll need to edit the `searchResults.scala.html` view
    * Docs for Play's templates: https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/ScalaTemplates
